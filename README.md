# belly-button-challenge

For this challenge we built out an interactive dashboard exporing the diverstity of microbes found in human belly buttons. 

Here's the link to the dashboard https://hlbecker08.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

D3 library was used to read in the dataset. We then used this data to create a bar chart and bubble chart displaying the amount and number of OTUs found depending on the selected test subject.

I worked with Conner Dekok on this challenge.
